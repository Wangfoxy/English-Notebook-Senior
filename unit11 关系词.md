# unit11 关系词

**关系代名词 = 连接词 + 代名词** 

- We met a man.  

  The man directed us to the factory. 

  合并：We met a man <font color = red>and he</font> directed us to the factory. 

  ```
  我们遇见一个男人并且他带领我们去工厂。
  ```

  = We met a man <font color = red>who</font> directed us to the factory.  



## 一、关系代名词的种类和格

#### 1.1 主格（+动词）

- I have a friend [<font color = red>who(=that) </font>likes music very much. ] 

  ```
  我有一个朋友并且他非常喜欢音乐。
  ```

#### 1.2 所有格（+名词） 

- The student[`whose` mother died yesterday] is absent today. 

  ```
  昨晚母亲去世的那个学生今天缺席了。
  ```

#### 1.3 受格（+主词 + 动词 +<介词>） 

- This is the man [<font color = red>whom</font> I spoke of].  

  ```
  这就是我说的那个人。// 受格关代可以省略，所以此处whom可以不写
  ```

**总结：** 这种类型的句子可以分为主要子句和关系子句，主要子句表达的是整体意思，关系子句由关代引导，一般都是修饰主要子句中的名词，使句子更加清晰，其实就是形容词的功能，所以关系子句也可以叫形容词子句。理解这种句子时要注意寻找关系子句，关系子句在句首或者句尾时，是显而易见的，如果关系子句在句中，那么从前往后找关代，从后往前找第一个动词，中间的都是关系子句的部分。



## 二、关系代名词的用法

#### 2.1 先行词为人的用法

主格用：who 

所有格用：whose

受格用：whom 

- I don't like people. 

  They lose their tempers easily.  // 形容词子句修饰people 

  I don't like people [<font color = red>who</font> lose their tempers easily.]   

  ```
  我不喜欢无法控制自己脾气的人。
  ```

- I have a classmate. 

  Her mother is a famous singer. // 形容词子句修饰classmate 

  I have a classmate [<font color = red>whose</font> mother is a famous singer. ] 

  ```
  我有一个同学他的母亲是一个著名的歌手。
  ```

- I met some friends.  

  I hadn't seen them for ages.  

  I met some friends [whom I hadn't seen them for ages.]

  ```
  我遇见一些很久没见的朋友。// 受格关代虽然代替的是关系子句中的受格，但是关代需要紧跟先行词，所以需要将受格关代放在关系子句的句首。
  ```

- 不吃肉类的人称为素食主义者。

  ```
  People [who don't eat meat] are called vegetarian. // 注意句子中的被动
  ```

- 所有[你所照顾的]孩子都会喜爱游泳。

  ```
  All the children [whom you take care of] will enjoy swimming.
  ```

#### 2.2 先行词为事物、动物的用法

主格用：which

所有格用：whose、of which

受格用：which  

- English is a language.  

  It is spoken all over the world.  

  English is a language which is spoken all over the world.

  ```
  英文是一门全世界都在使用的语言。 // 语言是被说，所以此处使用被动
  ```

- He looked for a car. 

  Its engine was in good condition.  

  He looked for a car whose engine was in good condition. 

  ```
  他要找一辆车况良好的车子。// It's是It is的缩写，表示所有格时不能加一撇
  ```

- He looked for a car.  

  The engine of the car was in good condition. 

  He looked for a car the engine of which was in good condition.

  ```
  与上句相同，但是此处用的是of which表示所有格代名词，虽然不常用，但是应该掌握
  ```

- Where is the parcel? 

  We received it this morning. 

  Where is the parcel (which) we received this morning. 

  ```
  我们早上收到的包裹去了哪里？ 
  ```

- This is a statement [which must be corrected.]

  ```
  这是一份必须更正的声明。
  ```

**注意：先行词为人、事物、动物时，主格与受格也可以用that** 

- He's in love with a girl who(=that) has red hair.  

  ```
  他正在和有红头发的女孩谈恋爱。
  ```

- Baseball is the sport which(=that) the most boys like. 

  ```
  棒球是大多数男孩喜欢的运动。
  ```

**重点：下列情况只能以that作为关系代名词**

> 先行词前面有最高级、序数  

- Today is the most coldest day (that) we have ever experienced.

  ```
  今天是我们经历过最寒冷的一天。
  ```

- The first thing [that you have to do] is (to) study mathematics.   

  ```
  头一件你需要做的事情就是研读数学。 
  // be动词后面的to一般是不写的，此处的study是原形不定词
  ```

> 先行词同时有人和事物 

- The driver and the car [<font color = red>that</font> had fallen into the sea] were quickly recovered. 

  ```
  掉进海里的司机和车子很快被捞起来了。
  ```

> 先行词中有疑问词who、which：避免重复 

- Who [that has common sense] could believe such a thing?  

  ```
  凡是有一点常识的人谁会相信这样的事情？
  ```

- Which is the picture that Mary Painted? 

  ```
  哪一幅画是Mary画的?
  ```

> 先行词为the only、ther very、the same等

- He is the only man that I love.  

  ```
  他是唯一我爱的人。
  ```

> 先行词为不定代名词或者~thing家族 

- All [that he said] was not true. 

  ```
  所有他说的东西都不是真的。
  ```

- My brother fixed almost anything [that needed repairing.] 

  ```
  我哥哥修理了所有需要修理的东西。
  ```

**重点：介系词的对象变为关代的情况** 

- Is that the man?  

  You lent the money to him.

  Is that the man [whom(that) you lent the money to?]  

  = Is that the man to whom you lent the money?

  ```
  那个人就是你借钱给他的那个人吗？
  ```

  ```
  由于介系词的对象变成关代提前了，可以将介系词也提前，放在关系子句的句首，但是一旦介系词提前那么关代就不能再使用that了，并且受格关代也不能省略。
  ```

- The train [which I'm waiting for] is now half an hour late. 

  = The train [for which I'm waiting] is now half an hour late. // 介系词抓到关代之前

  ```
  那班我正在等的火车现在已晚了半小时。 
  ```

**重点：如果`动词 / 形容词 + 介系词`组成片语，介系词只能放在后面**  

- This is the man [whom I worked with.]  

  = This is the man [with whom I worked.]  

  ```
  这个男人是和我一起工作的人。
  ```

  ```
  I worked with the man. with解释成和.....一起，是纯粹的介系词用法，可以将介系词抓到关代之前
  ```

- This is the habit wihich you must to do with. 

  ```
  这个习惯你必须戒掉。 
  ```

  ```
  戒掉习惯：do with the habit. 这是一整个有独立片语的意思，不能拆开，所以不能将介系词提前
  ```

  

#### 2.3 关系代名词的省略

##### 2.3.1 受格关代可以省略

- The lady [(whom) we met on the street] is our teacher.

  ```
  [我们在街上遇见的]女士是我们的老师。
  ```


##### 2.3.2 当补语的主格关代可以省略

- She was a cheerful girl.           她是一个充满活力的女孩。（过去） 

  She is not the cheerful girl.    她不是一个充满活力的女孩。（现在）

  She is not the cheerful girl [(that) she was.] 她不在是像以前一样充满朝气的女孩。

  ```
  这里的that是主格关代，代替the cheerful girl，并且跟在be动词的后面，所以是补语，一般动词后面的叫做受词。
  为什么that是主格关代？因为the cheerful girl并不是受词，而是补语，补充说明主格she,是主格的一部分。
  ```

##### 2.3.3 There / Here beV. 的句型中，关代可以省略

- There is someone [(who) wants to see you.] 

  ```
  有人想要见你。
  ```

##### 2.3.4 关代后面有There / Here beV. 时，关代可以省略

- This is the only bow tie [that is in this store. ]  // 先行词中有the only关代只能用that 

  = This is the only bow tie [that there is in this store.] 

  ```
  这是这家店里唯一的一个蝴蝶领结。
  ```

  

#### 2.4 what的用法

> what比较特殊可以等同于先行词加上关代 

| 先行词、格 | 主格 | 所有格 | 受格 |
| ---------- | ---- | ------ | ---- |
| 含先行词   | What | ----   | what |

##### 2.4.1 what的几种等同用法

- the thing(s) which 
- all that 
- anything that 

##### 2.4.2 what先行词用法的举例

- <font color = red>What</font> I want is peace of mind. 

  = <font color=red>The thing</font> [<font color = red>which</font> I want] is peace of mind. 

  ```
  我所想要的是心灵的平静。
  ```

  ```
  分析句子可知，“我所想要的”具体受词并没有说出来，所以使用what代替
  ```

- She told the detectives <font color = red>all</font> [<font color = red>that</font> they wanted to know.]  

  = She told the detectives [<font color = red>what</font> they wanted to know.] 

  ```
  她告诉侦探们[他们想要知道的]所有事情。
  ```

- I don't know what they were talking about.  

  - 我不知道他们谈论的事情。 // 这种翻译，what表示谈论的事情，是关代 

    what可以代换成：all that / the things which 

  - 我不知道他们在谈论什么。 // 这种翻译，what是疑问词 

##### 2.4.3 含有what的惯用表现

> what is called / what we（=you, they 根据对象不同替换） 
>
> call -> 所谓的 

- He is what is called a walking dictionary. 

  ```
  他们是所谓的活字典。
  walking dictionary:活字典
  ```

- She is what we call a musical genius. 

  ```
  她是所谓的音乐天才。
  ```

> A is to.... what B is to.....  
>
> A对于...的关系正如B对于...的关系

- Air is to us what water is to fish.  

  ```
  空气之于人犹如水之于鱼。
  ```

- Culture is to mind what food is to body. 

  ```
  文化之于心犹如食物之于身体。
  ```

> what A is （was / used to be）  今日的A / 昔日的A 

- She is not what she was ten years ago.

  ```
  她不再是十年前的她。
  ```

- What has made China what she is?  

  ```
  什么使得中国变成今天这种样子？ // 不知道多少个原因，状况不明视为单数
  ```

> what is + 比较级：更....的是  

- what is more（更好的是....; 而且....）  // 多指正面的方面 

  - He is bright boy, （and）what is more, he is kindhearted.  

    ```
    他是一个阳光的男孩，而且是亲切的。
    ```

- what is worse = to make matters worse  // 负面的方面

  - They lost their way, and what was worse, night was coming on. 

    ```
    他迷路了，更糟的是夜晚即将来临。
    ```

> what with... and （what with）....则因....;....则因....  // 通常指不好的原因 

- What with overwork and （what with）poor meals, she fell ill.  

  ```
  一是因为超时工作一是因为营养不良，她生病了。// fall - fell - fallen
  ```



## 三、限定用法和非限定用法

- We have two daughters [<font color = red>who</font> became nurses.] （限定用法） 

  ```
  我有两位成为护士的女儿。（有不止两个女儿，限定其中的两个成为了护士。） 
  ```

- We have two daughters, <font color = red>and they（=who）</font> became nurses. （非限定用法，补充叙述） 

  ```
  我有两位女儿她们成为了护士。（只有两个女儿）
  ```

限定用法没有逗号<font color =red>语调上扬</font>，补述用法是有逗号的<font color= red>语调下降</font> 

**重点：非限定用法** 

- I called Brian, who had called me while I was out. 

  ```
  我打电话给Brian是因为Brian在更早的时候打电话给我，在我外出的时候 
  // 注意其中的时态 who = because he 
  ```

  ```
  我买了一顶帽子，这顶帽子对我来说太大了。  // which = but it
  ```

- He bought some apples, two of which he gave her.  

  ```

  ```

- This poem, which everybody knows, is by Shelley.  

  ```
  大家都知道的那首诗是Shelley所写的。
  ```

- My mother expects me to become a doctor, which is not easy.

  ```
  他撕毁了我的照片让我很沮丧。
  // which指代he tore up my photo这件事 
  ```



## 四、关系副词

> 关系副词 = 连接词 + 副词

| 先行词   | 场所  | 时间 | 理由 | 无先行词 |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| 关系副词 | where | when | why  | how      |

#### 4.1 重点：where

- This is the place.  

  there I first met my wife.  

  合并：This is the place [where I first met my wife. ]

  ```
  这里就是我初次遇见我太太的地方。
  ```

- Here's a map of the town. 

  there Aunt Sally lives. 

  Here's a map of the town [where Aunt Sally lives. ]

  ```
  这里有一张Sally居住过城镇的地图。
  ```

- We found a restaurant [where the food is was delicious.]

  ```
  我们发现一家餐厅，那儿的食物精美可口。
  ```

> 注意：先行词为case、point、situation等，也可以用where 

- There are the cases [where this rule does not apply.] 

  ````
  这些是这些状况不使用的情形。
  ````



#### 4.2 重点：when

- Sunday is the day. 

  then I have no school. 

  合并：Sunday is the day [when I have no school.] 

  ```
  礼拜天那天我不用上学。
  ```

- That was the time.  

  then Dinosaurs lived. 

  That was the time [when Dinosaurs lived.]

  ```
  那是恐龙生存的时代。
  ```

- The day [when we can live in outer space] will come. 

  = The day will come [when we can live in outer space.]  

  ```
  我们可以住在外太空的这一天会来临。 
  虽然调换了位置，但是关系子句还是指the day,when代替的一定是时间
  ```



#### 4.3 重点：why

- The reason [why he was absent] wasn't clear. 

  ```
  他缺席的原因不明。 
  ```

- I really like sweets, that's the reason [why my teeth are bad.]     

  ```
  我真的很喜欢甜食。那就是[我牙齿不好的]原因。
  ```



#### 4.4 重点：how  通常没有明确的先行词

- This is <font color = red>how</font> the riot happened.   

  ```
  这就是发生暴动的原委。
  ```

- This is the way [<font color = red>that</font> he solved the problem.] 

  ```
  这是他解决问题的方法。
  // how通常没有明确的先行词，而此句有明确的先行词way所以只能用that
  ```



#### 4.5 注意事项

##### 4.5.1 关系副词的先行词，通常可以省略

- Tuesday is (the day) when the garbage truck comes.  

  ```
  星期二是[垃圾车来的]日子。 
  // 星期二指的就是时间，可以直接省略先行词，但是我们要看懂，不能把when翻译成当...时
  ```

- Late spring is (the time) [when the rainy season begins here.] 

  ```
  晚春是这里雨季开始的时期。
  ```

- This is (the reason) why I left early.  

  ```
  这是我早出发的理由。
  // 这句既可以省略the reason,也可以保留the reason反而省略why，只要能表明意思，就可以省略
  ```

##### 4.5.2 that有时候可以作为关系副词来代替where、when、why，通常代替when的情形比较多，此时that可以省略

- I remember the day little.   

  ```
  我几乎不记得跟她头一次见面的日子。
  ```

  ```
  little否定字，表示几乎不，为了使关系子句紧跟先行词the day，需要将little换个位置，little本身是副词可以将其挪到开头，而将little这种否定字换到开头之后需要使用倒装句型。
  所谓倒装句型实际上就类似于将陈述句变成疑问句而已，所以完整的句子如下
  Little do I remember the day [that(= when) I first met her.]  
  ```

- I don't like the way （that）he talks.  

  ```
  我不喜欢他说话的样子。  // 先行词为the way关代只能用that 
  ```

##### 4.5.3 关系副词where及when可用于非限定（补述）用法

- She moved to New York, where she opened a boutique. // 有逗号，补充说明 

  ```
  她搬去了纽约，在那里开了一家精品店。
  ```

- I was taking a shower, when the lights went out. 

  ```
  当我正在洗澡的时候灯熄灭了。
  ```

  



## 五、复合关系词

#### 5.1 关系代名词 + ever   表示任何一个

- whoever = <font color = red>anyone</font> who / who(m)ever = anyone who(m)  <font color = red>和在一起指代某人</font>

- whichever = <font color = red>any one</font> that / whatever = anything that   <font color = red>分开one代替单数名词</font>  

#### 5.2 关系副词 + ever 

> whenever = at any time when  

> wherever = at any place where  

- He tried to help <font color = red>anyone</font> [<font color = red>that</font> was in need of help. ]  

  He tried to help <font color = red>whoever</font> was in need of help.

  ```
  他设法帮助需要帮助的任何一个人。
  ```

- Help yourself to <font color = red>any one that</font> you want. 

  Help youself to <font color = red>whichever</font> you want. 

  ```
  自行取用任何[你想要的]东西。
  ```

- I'll treat today, you can order <font color = red>anything that</font> you like.

  I'll treat today, you can order <font color = red>whatever</font> you like. 

  ```
  今天我请客，你可以点任何你喜欢的东西。 
  ```

#### 5.3 复合关系词可以表示让步：无论....

whoever = no matter who 

whichever = no matter which 

whatever = no matter what 

whenever = no matter when 

wherever = no matter where 

however = no matter how

- Whoever is calling, I don't want to answer the phone. 

  ```
  无论是谁打电话来，我都不想要接。
  ```

- Whatever happens I'll always love you. 

  No matter what happens I'll always love you. // 等价写法

  ```
  无论发生什么事情，我都会永远爱你。
  ```

- I'll be thinking of you wherever I am

  ```
  无论我在哪里，我都会想起你。
  ```

- However fast you may walk, you will not be able to arrive before dark.

  ```
  无论你能走得多快，天黑前还是无法到达。
  ```

  

## 六、关系形容词及as、but、than

#### 6.1 关系形容词 = 连接词 + 形容词

- I gave the child all the little money.  我给了这个小孩所有的零钱。

  I had all the little money then.  我所拥有的所有零钱。

  合并：I gave the child all the little money that I had then.  

  ```
  我给了这个小孩我所拥有的所有零钱。
  ```

  ```
  that指代前面的all the little money
  I是主词，gave是动词，the child是受词，the little是名词，all the是不定形容词，表示数量不定，不知道有多少数量
  ```

  = I gave the child what little money I had then.

  ```
  all the + 名词 + that = what + 名词
  ```

- Nancy waited with all the patience. Nancy很耐心的等待。

  She could command all the patience. 她发挥最大的耐心等待。

  合并：Nancy waited with all the patience that she could command.

  ```
  Nancy用所有的耐性等待。
  that指代先行词all the patience
  ```

  = Nancy waited with what patience she could command. 

- For ten days, <font color = red>in(=during) which time</font> he kept indoors, nobody visited him.  

  ```
  有十天之久，在这段期间他一直待在家，没人来走访。
  which指代前面的ten days
  ```

- We may miss the train, <font color = red>in which case</font> we'll be late for the oppointment. 

  ```
  我们可能会错过火车，如此一来我们的约会就会迟到。
  ```

  

#### 6.2 重点：as、but、than也可以扮演关代的角色

- Oil and water do not mix, and we all know that. 

  = Oil and water do not mix, as we all know.

  ```
  油和水不能混合，我们都知道这件事情。
  ```

  ```
  关代 = 连接词 + 代名词 
  所以句子中的and + that可以用as代替，as可以解释成如同....、就像.....
  ```

- I wear eamings.    我戴耳环。 

  She wears the same earrings.  她也戴一样的耳环。

  合并：She wears the same earrings that I wear（=do）. // 动词重复用do代替

  = She wears the same earrings as I do. // as语气更加强烈 

- He came late for class today, and that is often the case with him. 

  = As is often the case （with him）,he came late for class today.

  ```
  一如往常他今天上课又迟到了。
  ```

  ```
  and + that可以用as代换，代换之后可以将as引导的子句放在开头，这种用法更加类似于惯用表现，as并不是没有先行词
  ```

- Read such books your teacher has recommended. 

  = Read such books as your teacher has recommended. 

**but用于否定句，形成双重否定** 

- There is no rule [that doesn't have any exceptions.] 

  = There is no rule but has some exceptions. 

  ```
  but本身就是连接词，而自身又扮演主词的角色，表示相反的意思
  ```

  = Every rule has some exceptions. 每个规则都有一些例外。

**than用于比较句** 

- You did work [that I had expected.]  你做了我期待的工作。 

  You did more work than I had expected. 你做了比我期待更多的工作。

- You have clothing.  你有衣服。

  The clothing is necessary. 这件衣服是需要的。

  合并：You have clothing [that is necessary.] 你有所需要的衣服。

  You have more clothing than is necessary. 你有比所需要的更多的衣服。
